			<h4>College Life</h4>
			<h3>	I am a current student at Mount Saint Mary's University studying Mathematics and Computer Science.
			I have always performed well at Math and have developed a love for it in College.
			While at Mount St. Mary's I have done many different activities. 
			During my first two years of college I was on the D1 swim team. I was continuing my swimming career but I got a spinal injury that finally made me hang up my cap and goggles.
			I love swimming with all my heart and would deffinetly do those 14 years of my life again. </h3>
			
			<h3>	Ending my swimming career might have been one of the best things that could have happened to me.
			It allowed me to have a ton more free time and that allowed me to get involved with so many different activies. 
			One of the first things I ended up doing was getting several differnt jobs on campus. 
			Some of them being a head peer tutor, a student instructor for various math courses, and being an Admissions Student Recuiter. 
			One of the other big activies that I got involed with is Makers House.
			Makers House is a place where you can be creative and build things. 
			It has everything you could imagine. 
			It has a Woodshop, Craft lab, Ceramics, Fab lab, and more. 
			It is a place that I met some of my best friedns there, and quickly became my favorite place on Campus. </h3>
			
			<h3>	After I graduate I am joining an organization called Fellowship Of Catholic University Students (FOCUS). 
			I plan to be in FOCUS for two years and then look into getting a job dealing data anyalitcs. </h3>
